# LPTHW3-Ex-36

This is exercise 36 from LPTHW3. It's a choose-your-own-adventure style game. It's function-based as opposed to OOP.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for your enjoyment. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need these things to run the game:

```
Python 3.x, PlaySound
```

### Installing

#### Python

Go here to get Python up and running on your machine:
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#pythonanywhere\

Click on 'Install Python' for whatever your operating system is. Example:

```
Install Python: Windows
```
#### PlaySound

Go here to install PlaySound (this is a simple library that plays audio for the game):
https://pypi.org/project/playsound/

It'll tell you to run this command in your terminal:

```
pip3 install playsound
```
Then download the Game Files folder and all its contents.

## Deployment

When you download everything from above, open the folder 'Game Files' on your computer. Then open a terminal from that directory. Then type the following:

```
python3 Ex36.py
```
And that's it! The game should run. Have fun and feel free to reach out if there's any bugs.
