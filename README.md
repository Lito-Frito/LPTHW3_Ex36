# LPTHW3_Ex36
This is exercise 36 from LPTHW3. It's a choose-your-own-adventure style game.

You'll need the .wav files (included) and the Playsound library (see below) for the game to run.

Instructions for Playsound:
https://pypi.org/project/playsound/

Make sure the .wav files are all in the same directory as Ex36.py when you run the script.
